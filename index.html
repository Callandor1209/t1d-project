        <p class="two">Type 1 diabetes is a very complex autoimmune disease that about 8.7 million people currently suffer from. As of right now, there is no known cure for type one, only increasingly more complex ways of caring for it. If you have been diagnosed, or know someone that has been diagnosed with T1D and you are feeling a bit lost on how to care for them, then you are in the right place. Here our goal is to provide "tutorials" from many different perspectives, including parents of children with type 1 diabetes, children with it, adults with it, and even spouses with it. We aim to have perspectives from those with different kinds of technology, for example the omnipod vs the tandem insulin pumps, and the Libre vs the Dexcom continuous glucose monitors. Being diagnosed with T1D is life changing, but it doesn't always have to be bad. If you care for it, you will find that your life will probably change for the better, for example after I was diagnosed it pushed me to workout more often and eat better to maintain more control over my blood sugar. If you follow our tutorials here, you will hopefully leave with a better knowledge of your body and how it works, and with more strategies for treating your disease than before.  </p>
